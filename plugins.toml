# Plugin Configuration
# ====================
# Plugins run as Docker containers managed by Docker Compose.
# URLs are configured via environment variables (e.g., GAMBIT_URL).
#
# Plugin endpoints: GET /health, GET /info, POST /analyze, POST /parse/{format}

[settings]
# Maximum seconds to wait for a plugin container to become healthy
# PyCID plugin takes ~30s to import libraries on first load
startup_timeout_seconds = 60

# Plugin Definitions
# ------------------
# Each [[plugins]] entry defines one plugin service.
# URLs come from environment variables: {NAME}_URL (e.g., GAMBIT_URL)
